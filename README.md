The data appears to be related to demographic and purchasing information, specifically focusing on bike sales. 
The datasets include various attributes such as marital status, gender, income, number of children, education level, occupation, home ownership, number of cars, commute distance, region, age, and whether a bike was purchased.
This project contains a interactive dashboard which provides an overview of the sales data and allows users to explore key metrics and trends like,
Individuals with a commute distance of 2-5 Miles have the highest likelihood of purchasing a bike,
Individuals commuting 10+ Miles have the lowest likelihood of purchasing a bike,
Professionals are the most likely to purchase bikes,
Manual workers are the least likely to purchase bikes.
This project can be used to analyze factors influencing bike purchases, such as demographic information, income, and lifestyle choices.
